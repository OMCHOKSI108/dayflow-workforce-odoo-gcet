## 3. CHECKLIST FOR RECORDING

### Preparation
- [ ] **Clean Data**: clear test data or create fresh "Demo User" and "Demo Admin" accounts.
- [ ] **Reset State**: Ensure the Employee is "Checked Out" before you start, so you can show the Check-In action.
- [ ] **Script**: Have bullet points ready on a second screen or piece of paper. Do not read word-for-word, just talk naturally.
- [ ] **Resolution**: Record in 1080p (1920x1080).
- [ ] **Audio**: Use a quiet room. Test your microphone volume first.

### During Recording
- [ ] **Mouse Movements**: Move strictly and smoothly to where you want to click. Avoid jiggling the mouse while talking.
- [ ] **Pacing**: Don't rush. Click -> Pause for half a second implies the system is working -> Then Explain.
- [ ] **Zoom**: If a text is small (like a notification), you can zoom in slightly in post-production, or use browser zoom (110%) during recording.

### Post-Recording
- [ ] **Trim**: Cut out the start/end awkward pauses.
- [ ] **Speed**: If a page load is slow, speed that specific part up in the editor.
